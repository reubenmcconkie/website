    <h1><center>Top Ten Deadly Animals in the World</center></h1>
    <h2><b>10. Hippopotamus </b></h2>
    <h3><p>Hippos are responsible for 500 annual deaths. They are especially dangerous in water, as they often times feel threatened by boats and will charge at them, sending the people on board into the water where they either drown or are killed by the hippo.</p></h3>
    <h2><b>9. Elephant</b></h2>
    <h3><p>Elephants, also responsible for around 500 annual deaths, are mistaken for being harmless by their typically gentle nature. However, due to loss of habitat land, elephants are coming into contact with people more regularly, and are able to kill people easily, whether by accident or on purpose. </p></h3>
    <h2><b>8. Saltwater Crocodile</b></h2>
    <h3><p>Saltwater crocodiles are responsible for 1,000 annual deaths. They are reptiles and therefore cold-blooded, which means they have to be in the sun to stay warm lots of the time. This can be deceptive and taken as laziness -- but they can reach up to almost 20 mph when chasing prey, and can weigh more than a ton.</p></h3>
    <h2><b>7. Ascaris Roundworms</b></h2>
    <h3><p>This worm is responsible for roughly 2,600 annual deaths; more than double the saltwater crocodile. They are parasites and latch onto a host when their eggs are consumed, usually when food or water is contaminated with human fecal matter.</p></h3>
    <h2><b>6. Scorpions</b></h2>
    <h3><p>Also responsible for around 2,600 annual deaths, scorpion stings are usually caused when people step on them while they are hiding in the person's shoes or when they are overlooked in general. Only 25 of over 2,000 species of scorpions have lethal doses of venom, but even that many still causes that much death.</p></h3>
    <h2><b>5. Assassin Bugs(Kissing Bugs)</b></h2>
    <h3><p>Assassin bugs, responsible for more than 10,000 deaths each year, aren't inherently deadly -- rather, they carry the bacteria known as the Chagas disease, found in Central and South America, and this is what causes so many deaths. Side note, they are called "kissing bugs" because they bite people's faces while they sleep.</p></h3>
    <h2><b>4. Saw-Scaled Viper</b></h2>
    <h3><p>This species of snake is responsible for almost 140,000 deaths each year. This number gave it the title of World's Deadliest Snake by mortality rate. Although it is not the most venomous of snakes, it is one of the most aggressive, and it's presence near highly populous areas makes it very dangerous.</p></h3>
    <h2><b>3. Freshwater Snails</b></h2>
    <h3><p>A snail is able to kill 200,000 people annually, which, for reference, is 400 times more than the hippo or the elephant. This is because they carry incredibly dangerous worms known as "flukes", which act as contagions through water as a medium, meaning that people can catch the lethal virus by being in the same water as the snail. The only parasitic disease more devastating than this one is Malaria, according to the World Health Organization.</p></h3>
    <h2><b>2. Humans</b></h2>
    <h3><p>This may sound like old news to many people, but humans are responsible for between 400,000 and 500,000 deaths per year, from things like homicide to violence to impoverished conditions. The World Health Organization estimates that in the next two decades, this number will increase by around 250,000.</p></h3>
    <h2><b>1. Mosquitos</b></h2>
    <h3><p>Responsible for more than a million annual deaths in some countries, mosquitos are by far the most deadly animal known to humans. Their feeding on animal and human blood alike allows them to carry a myriad of diseases that anyone is susceptible to, especially in poorer countries without medical care. They are also responsible for carrying Malaria, one of the most deadliest diseases that humans have ever encountered.
